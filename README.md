# FANX Digital Service Economy

**FANX** — Deflationary, DAO-governed, closed-loop digital service economy.

This repository contains:
- the economic model (XP → Credit → Burn → Value ↑ → NEV ↑),
- DAO governance mechanics,
- legal/regulatory compliance framing (SPK / MASAK / MiCA / VARA),
- and a working Streamlit simulator you can deploy publicly.

## 🔁 Core Logic
1. Users create value (XP) through tasks, content, interaction.
2. XP converts to FANX Credit (closed-loop utility credit).
3. Every spend / message / content unlock burns Credit (supply ↓).
4. Supply ↓ while NEV (ecosystem income) ↑ ⇒ unit value tends to ↑.
5. Rewards are distributed from Fan Pool by contribution score (not passive yield).

## 🚀 Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/app.py
```

Then open the local URL Streamlit shows you.
