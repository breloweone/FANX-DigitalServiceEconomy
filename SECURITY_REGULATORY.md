# SECURITY & REGULATORY POSITIONING

## 1. Core claim
FANX is **not**:
- an investment product,
- a gambling / betting scheme,
- a public crypto asset,
- or a money transfer service.

FANX **is** a closed-loop digital service economy:
- Users perform digital tasks / create content.
- The system records that contribution as XP.
- XP converts to Credit (utility credit usable only inside FANX).
- Credit can be "cashed out" only as payment for already delivered service
  (TBK m.393 service compensation logic).

## 2. SPK (Turkey)
Reward is not passive yield. There is no "you put money and wait".
Reward is contribution-based payout.
Therefore it is outside the scope of an "investment contract" under SPKn.

## 3. MASAK / FATF
- Closed loop: Credit cannot be transferred to external wallets.
- KYC is required before cashout.
- Cashout = "service fee settlement", logged to ledger.
- This aligns with FATF guidance for non-transferable internal credits.

## 4. MiCA (EU)
MiCA targets transferable crypto-assets.
FANX Credit is *non-transferable* and cannot circulate in external markets.
Therefore it is treated as a closed-loop utility credit, not a crypto-asset
requiring authorization.

## 5. VARA / DIFC (Dubai)
VARA regulates Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).
FANX does **not**: list, broker, market-make, or bridge tokens externally.
Therefore DAO operations are not VASP activity.

## 6. FSEK / IP chain
- Creators keep economic rights (FSEK m.21–25).
- Fans get a non-exclusive usage license (FSEK m.52).
- Platform is an intermediary service provider (FSEK m.77/A).
- Every paid access event triggers micro-burn (supply↓), which is *not*
  a securities / speculation event but a scarcity mechanic.

## 7. TL;DR for regulators
"This is a closed, auditable, contribution-driven digital service
ecosystem. It is not an investment market."
